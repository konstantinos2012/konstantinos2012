After selecting with the students distinguished writers of the local community we will find the buildings in which they lived and integrate them into a single structure, gathering information that links the building and the man, highlighting unknown aspects of his life. Finally, we want to create an imaginary route, perhaps on a google map, for the purpose of taking a literary walk that will connect architecture with literature.&lt;/p&gt;
