<p>Manolis Anagnostakis (March 10th, 1925 â€“ June 23rd, 2005) was a Greek poet and critic at the forefront of the Marxist and existentialist poetry movements arising during and after the Greek Civil War in the late 1940s. Anagnostakis was a leader amongst his contemporaries and influenced the generation of poets immediately after him. His poems have been honored in Greeceâ€™s national awards and arranged and sung by contemporary musicians.
He was born in Thessaloniki, where he went to medical school. During the [Axis] Occupation he took part in the E.P.O.N. (United Pan-Hellenic Organization of the Youth= an anti-fascist group organizing the student resistance movements throughout Greece). During the two-year-span 1943-1944 he was the chief editor of the magazine â€œXekinemaâ€ [â€œBeginningâ€] of a branch of the University of Thessaloniki. He had intense political activity in the student movement, for which he was imprisoned in 1948, while in 1949 he was sentenced to death by a special court martial. He got out of prison in 1951 with the general amnesty.
From 1955-1956 he became a specialist in radiology in Vienna, following which he practiced radiology for a period of time in Thessaloniki; he settled in Athens in 1978.
His first published pieces appeared in the magazine Letters from Piraeus (1942) and later in the student magazine â€œBeginningâ€(1944). His poems, as well as pieces of criticism, were published in many magazines. From 1959-1961 he worked with the magazine â€œCriticism,â€ and was a part of the publishing teams of Eighteen Pieces (1970), New Pieces and the magazine â€œContinuationâ€ (1973).
In 1986 the State Poetry Prize was conferred upon him, and in 1997 he was proclaimed an honorary Doctor of the University of Thessaloniki.
Composers such as Mikis Theodorakis, Thanos Mikroutsikos and Michalis Gregoriou have set many of his poems to music, and his works have been translated into English, French, German and Italian.
His ancestry was from the village Roustika Rethymnis, where his fatherâ€™s house is preserved.</p>
