<p>Through this project, our students hope to gain the ability to collaborate and communicate with their classmates, the ability to think critically and to be able to walk around their city and get to know the writers in their area. Our specific goals are for our students to learn to orient themselves in the city, to walk around observing the urban environment, to read local community writers, and to learn information about their personal lives.</p>
